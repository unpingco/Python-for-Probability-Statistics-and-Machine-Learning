    "With the exception of the random forest, we have so far considered machine\n",
    "learning models as stand-alone entities. Combinations of models that jointly\n",
    "produce a classification are known as *ensembles*.  There are two main\n",
    "methodologies that create ensembles: *bagging* and *boosting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging refers to bootstrap aggregating, where bootstrap here is the same as we\n",
    "discussed in the section [ch:stats:sec:boot](#ch:stats:sec:boot).  Basically,\n",
    "we resample the data with replacement and then train a classifier on the newly\n",
    "sampled data. Then, we combine the outputs of each of the individual\n",
    "classifiers using a majority-voting scheme (for discrete outputs) or a weighted\n",
    "average (for continuous outputs).  This combination is particularly effective\n",
    "for models that are easily influenced by a single data element. The resampling\n",
    "process means that these elements cannot appear in every bootstrapped\n",
    "training set so that some of the models will not suffer these effects. This\n",
    "makes the so-computed combination of outputs less volatile. Thus, bagging\n",
    "helps reduce the collective variance of individual high-variance models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of bagging, let's suppose we have a two-dimensional plane that\n",
    "is partitioned into two regions with the following boundary: $y=-x+x^2$.\n",
    "Pairs of $(x_i,y_i)$ points above this boundary are labeled one and points\n",
    "below are labeled zero. [Figure](#fig:ensemble_001) shows the two regions\n",
    "with the  nonlinear separating boundary as the black curved line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- dom:FIGURE: [fig-machine_learning/ensemble_001.png, width=500 frac=0.75]\n",
    "Two regions in the plane are separated by a nonlinear boundary. The training\n",

    "that it uses a majority-voting (or averaging for numeric prediction) process at\n",
    "the end; and it also combines individual classifiers of the same type. On the\n",
    "other hand, boosting is serially iterative, whereas the individual classifiers\n",
    "in bagging can be trained in parallel.  Boosting uses the misclassifications of\n",
    "prior iterations to influence the training of the next iterative classifier by\n",
    "weighting those misclassifications more heavily in subsequent steps. This means\n",
    "that, at every step, boosting focuses more and more on specific\n",
